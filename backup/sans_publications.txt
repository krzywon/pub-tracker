We exploit the ability of PDES networks to form a strain-induced mesophase to demonstrate the tendency of longer guest chains to phase separate or partition selectively to the amorphous phase and the tendency of smaller guest chains to remain distributed between the mesophase and the amorphous phase. The segmental orientation of the guest chains measured via 2H NMR peak splitting can be interpreted in terms of an enthalpic orientational coupling of the chain segments in the amorphous state. SANS results show that the radius of gyration of guest chains in the unstretched networks and in the networks stretched below the mesomorphic transition remains essentially unchanged from that in the melt state. The scattering intensity from SANS patterns for networks with guest chains of any size has a peak in the direction parallel to the stretch direction that reflects the domain spacing of the lamellae in the mesophase."

At the gel point, the solution rheology follows the scaling predicted by classical percolation theory, with G' ~ G'' ~ . We argue that this scaling could be due either to formation of a percolated network or to a pretransitional glassy phase."

At ambient pressure, the structure is a network of branched, semiflexible, cylindrical micelles with the branch points comprised of three-armed junctions. Our SANS results reveal that pressure induces a phase transition from this network of threadlike micelles to hexagonally ordered bundles of cylindrical micelles. Using geometric packing constraints for three-arm junctions and cylinders, we show that the formation of three-arm junctions becomes increasingly unfavorable with increasing pressure due to the compression of the micelle hydrophobic core, and as such, the network becomes unstable at pressures close to those observed in our SANS experiments. We also measured the temperature dependence of the transition pressure and find that it follows the pressure-temperature freezing curves for liquid n-alkanes of comparable hydrocarbon chain length. These observations lead us to propose that the phase transition is related to a loss of flexibility or conformational entropy of the C12E5 micelles upon the pressure-induced freezing of the micelle hydrophobic core to form an amorphous solid. The formation of hexagonally ordered bundles of cylindrical micelles follows as attractive van der Waals forces between the micelles are not offset by the loss of repulsive undulation forces arising from the fluidity of the hydrophobic core."

Three main void components were identified in the deposits: intrasplat cracks, interlamellar planar pores, and globular pores. The SANS and MSANS measurements were analyzed using the traditional theory for Porod scattering and a recently developed three-component model for MSANS evaluation. The average size, volume fraction, internal surface area, and orientation distribution for each void component within the deposits were determined. This study focused on gaining a better understanding of the effects of initial feedstock particle size and annealing temperatures on the microstructure of deposits sprayed under equivalent particle-impact conditions. Quantitative results are presented for each of four deposit samples: one prepared using the as-received feedstock particle wide-size distribution and three prepared from feedstock powder of different and relatively narrow particle size ranges with average sizes of 32, 47, and 88 ?m. Except for the coarse (88 ?m) feedstock powder, only mild monotonic variations were found in the microstructural anisotropies, the porosities (13 ± 1%), or the internal surface areas in the as-sprayed deposits. The internal surface area was independent of the feedstock particle size, even with the coarse feedstock. When the deposits were annealed at high temperatures (1100 and 1400 °C), the microstructures were altered with a reduction of the total internal surface area and a mild coarsening of the voids. These changes in the microstructural evolution were well-captured and described by the three-component model. The result were compared and related with those obtained from scanning electron microscopy images and elastic moduli measurements."

IPNs were made by the in situ polymerisation/crosslinking of styrene in the dispersed styrene-rich phase of block copolymers with a crosslinked elastomeric matrix. Such networks when optimally prepared can combine stiffness with toughness. In this work the ratio of stiff and hard segments (controlled by styrene/isoprene or butadiene ratio) and morphology have been altered, and two families of block copolymers, with linear and radial structures are compared. The morphology of a brittle IPN is compared with a tough analogue, using small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The former reveals substantial orientation in the drawn material, whereas the TEM shows similar structures for both. When radial thermoplastic elastomer IPNs are prepared, the structure is found to be isometric by SANS, as shown by intensity versus scattering vector, q, data for sample sections cut in two directions. The linear thermoplastic elastomer IPNs show quite different scattering, consistent with the rod-like dispersed phases previously established by TEM. The size of the hard, dispersed domains appears to be comparable using TEM and SANS, the latter giving a more sensitive indication of orientation. This possibly reflects the advantages of strong signal generation from a bulk sample, which has undergone little alteration during characterization."

We analyze SANS intensity distributions assuming that the micelles are spherical and interact among themselves by an effective pair potential, consisting of a hard core plus a narrow attractive square well, the depth of which is temperature dependent. The theory is able to account for the intensity distribution quantitatively when the micellar system is in the liquid phase (but qualitatively when the micellar system is in the glass state), giving values of four parameters: the aggregation number of the micelle N, the volume fraction occupied by the micelles , the fractional width of the square well , and the effective temperature T* = kBT/u, where u is the depth of the square well. Thus, we are able to assign a point in the phase diagram (the T*- plane) for each measured micellar liquid and glass state. Comparison with a phase diagram predicted recently by mode coupling theory calculation allows us to identify the existence of the so-called liquid-to-attractive-glass transition line. We also found the evidence of glass-to-glass transition at volume fraction of 0.54 predicted by the mode coupling theory."

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were made over a range of contrasts for three latexes at high and low pH. Parameters obtained by fitting to standard core/shell models were consistent with the shell being highly hydrated (about 89% at low pH and about 94% at high pH). The core was found to contain about 3% acrylic acid. Doubling the proportion of acrylic acid in the recipe increased shell thickness by about 20%, slightly reduced particle size and slightly increased the proportion of acrylic acid incorporated into the core. The maximum degree of polymerization (DOP) of the entering (and therefore grafted) species was estimated from the shell thickness to be about 44 monomer units for 0.02 M acrylic acid and 66 for 0.04 M. The observed dependence of hairy layer (shell) thickness on the initial amount of acrylic acid suggests that the critical DOP for entry (and therefore true grafting) of the electrosteric stabilizer is thermodynamically (not kinetically) controlled."

The phase boundary is located at pressures near 600 bar at 130 C, and it exhibits a minimum in temperature near 105 C where the cloud-point pressure rises sharply. Neutron scattering is performed with a high-pressure scattering cell designed for a large incident beam diameter, good mixing, and real-time viewing of the solution to ensure single-phase operation. The SANS results suggest significant variations in intramolecular correlations exist at length scales proportional to a few monomer units although the radius of gyration remains close to the unperturbed value at pressures from the cloud point to as high as 2400 bar. As expected, the intermolecular correlation length grows rapidly on approach to the phase boundary. The phase behavior and SANS data suggest that DME is very poor quality solvent even at high solvent densities."

The location of the order-disorder transition was confirmed by SAXS. The temperature dependence of the Flory-Huggins parameter, , of SF copolymers, determined by SAXS, is similar in magnitude to that between polystyrene and polyisoprene chains. We find that is independent of block copolymer composition (within experimental error).

In the present work, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) was used to study the effects of one such bile salt, sodium taurocholate (NaTC), on the size and polydispersity of AOT reversed micelles. At low concentrations, NaTC decreases the overall size of the reversed micelles, the size of the interior water pools, and the apparent thickness of the detergent layer, while causing an increase in polydispersity. At higher NaTC concentrations, the overall aggregate size, the size of the water pools, the thickness of the detergent layer, and the polydispersity all are increased. It is proposed that, at low concentrations, NaTC monomers are randomly dispersed among the AOT molecules in a perpendicular orientation, thereby disrupting the organization of the detergent layer and increasing penetration of heptane and water into the detergent layer. When NaTC is increased, it may form hydrogen-bonded dimers that are aligned parallel to the AOT molecules. In this orientation, there is less disruption of the detergent layer and penetration of heptane and water molecules is reduced. Finally, it was found that reversed micelles containing chymotrypsin are smaller than unoccupied aggregates, suggesting structural reorganization in order to accommodate the protein. From these results, the effects of NaTC on chymotrypsin activity in AOT reversed micelles can be attributed to structural and chemical modification of the detergent layer rather than to changes in the overall dimensions of the reversed micelles."

The magnitudes of the interaction in the star/linear blends are small enough that bulk phase separation is unlikely, whereas that in the comb/linear blend is about 20 times higher for the same number of arms. Thus, bulk phase separation can be readily expected for comb/linear blends at commercially relevant values of molecular weights."

However, the three-dimensional structure of double-headed myosin consisting of two S1 subfragments has not yet been solved. Therefore, to investigate the overall shape and relative orientations of the two heads of myosin, we performed small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering measurements of heavy meromyosin containing all three light chains (LC1-3) in solution. The resulting small-angle scattering intensity profiles were best fit by models of the heavy meromyosin head-tail junction in which the angular separation between heads was less than 180 degrees. The S1 heads of the best fit models are not related by an axis of symmetry, and one of the two S1 heads is bent back along the rod. These results provide new information on the structure of the head-tail junction of myosin and indicate that combining scattering measurements with high resolution structural modeling is a feasible approach for investigating myosin head-head interactions in solution."

The droplets were formed by expanding dilute mixtures of condensible vapor in a N2 carrier gas through a supersonic nozzle, while maintaining the onset of condensation at a fixed position in the nozzle. It is remarkable, given the small coherent scattering length density of light water, that even the pure H2O aerosol gave a scattering signal above background. The scattering spectra were analyzed assuming a log-normal distribution of droplets. On average, the geometric radius of the nanodroplets rg was rg = 13 (±1) nm, the polydispersity ln r was ln r = 0.19 (±0.07), and the number density N was N = (2±0.2)·1011 cm3. The aerosol volume fractions derived from the SANS measurements are consistent with those derived from the pressure trace experiments, suggesting that the composition of the droplets was close to that of the initial condensible mixture. A quantitative analysis of the scattering spectra as a function of the isotopic composition gave further evidence that the binary droplets exhibit ideal mixing behavior. Because both the stagnation temperature T0 and the location of onset were fixed, the temperature corresponding to the maximum nucleation rate was constant at TJ max = 229 (±1) K. Thus, the experiments let us estimate the isothermal peak nucleation rates as a function of the isotopic composition. The nucleation rates were found to be essentially constant with Jmax equal to (3.6±0.5)·1016 cm3 s1 at a mean supersaturation of 44 (±3)."

The scattering response of a bimodal gel made by hydrosilylation is compared with that of a monomodal gel made by condensation curing having nearly identical shear moduli. Significant differences in the microscopic structure are revealed by SANS. In the bimodal gels made by hydrosilylation, the scattering spectrum can be described by two characteristic length scales, one dynamic and one static. The condensation cured sample contains in addition very large structures, possibly due to solid precipitation as a byproduct of the condensation reaction.

The synthesis utilizes equilibrium vesicles as templates for the directed growth of silica. Two different surfactant systems are used to form the vesicular templates: (a) mixtures of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium perfluorooctanoate (FC7) and (b) mixtures of cetyltrimethylammonium tosylate (CTAT) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS). These templates were chosen because these mixtures of surfactants in water form unilamellar vesicles spontaneously that appear stable in the chemical environment required for silica synthesis. Tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) is added to the vesicular templates as a precursor for silica formation via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and polycondensation. The morphology of the silica products as observed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), quasi-elastic light scattering (QLS), and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is consistent with silica deposition at the vesicle surface, creating hollow silica particles with a 1-2-nm-thick shell and with a core diameter identical to that of the template.

To understand and optimize potential processing conditions, organically modified montmorillonite clays were dispersed in a number of organic solvents covering a range of solubility parameters and characterized using small-angle neutron scattering and wide-angle X-ray scattering techniques. The organic modifier was dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium. Both as-received (unextracted) and purified (extracted) organically modified clays were studied. The scattering profiles and dispersion behavior in organic solvents of the dry powder of unextracted and of extracted dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow montmorillonite are significantly different, confirming that the organic modifiers are present in excess in the unextracted material as reported by the industrial provider. The scattering data show that both unextracted and extracted organically modified clay platelets were fully exfoliated in chloroform while the platelets retain their lamellar structure and swell to a similar extent in benzene, toluene, and p-xylene, but the extracted material has a stronger tendency to gel. The scattering profiles indicate that the swollen tactoids of extracted material are thinner, and therefore more numerous, which may account for the bulk suspension behavior. The extracted clay dispersion exhibited a concentration dependence on the scattering for all the organic solvents studied except chloroform while the unextracted clay dispersion did not. Neither the extracted nor the unextracted dispersions exhibited any temperature dependence on the scattering. The thickness of unmodified montmorillonite platelets was found to be 9.9 Å while that of organically modified montmorillonite platelets was determined to be 24.3 Å using wide-angle X-ray scattering. The lateral size of organically modified montmorillonite platelets was observed to be in the range of 0.4-1.0 m using atomic force microscopy."

Here in part 2, we examine surface segregation of these peptide-modified and unmodified comb polymers blended with polylactide (PLA) as a self-assembly approach suitable for surface modification of porous tissue engineering scaffolds. Multiple thermodynamic driving forces for surface enrichment of the comb polymer are exploited by annealing PLA/P(MMA-r-POEM) blends above the glass transition of the blend components but below the melting point of PLA, while in contact with water. Predictions of the interfacial composition profiles of annealed blends were made using a self-consistent field (SCF) lattice model. The calculations predict strong enrichment of the comb in the top ~50 Å of blends, and organization of comb molecules in quasi-2D conformations at the interface, similar to the apparent structure of pure comb surfaces in contact with water described in part 1. Experimentally, PLA/comb blend surfaces were characterized by contact angle measurements, XPS, quantification of ligand-cluster surface density and stability by AFM and fluorescent nanosphere labeling, and cell attachment assays. These data were consistent with SCF predictions, showing significant enrichment of the comb at water-annealed surfaces and RGD cluster densities consistent with 2D conformations for comb molecules in the surface layer. Bulk miscibility of the blends was verified by dynamic rheometry, small-angle neutron scattering, DSC and X-ray diffraction studies. Surface segregation of combs provided tunable cell adhesion on PLA through surface-localized nanoclusters of RGD atop a cell-resistant background."

The last three of these are able to kinetically suppress hydrate crystallization, and their inhibitor activity ranges from moderate to very effective. This attribute is of significant commercial importance to the oil and gas industry, but the mechanism of the activity is unknown. The dilute-solution polymer conformation in a hydrate-forming tetrahydrofuran/water fluid shows little difference among the four polymers: the majority of the scattering is that expected for a polymer in a good solvent. Each solution also exhibits some additional low-q scattering which we attribute to aggregates. In the presence of a hydrate-crystal/liquid slurry, the three inhibitor polymers significantly change their conformation. Utilizing results from our previous contrast variation study, we show that this arises from polymer adsorbed to the hydrate-crystal surface. Furthermore, we find a strong correlation between the scattering intensity at low q values and the effectiveness of the inhibitor polymer. We suggest this is an indication that as surface adsorption increases, the inhibitor's blocking of growth sites increases. Also measured for one of the kinetic-inhibitor polymers was the dilute-solution polymer conformation in a hydrate-forming propane/water fluid (hydrate crystal free). This system shows additional low-q scattering, possibly indicating a polymerpropane interaction prior to crystal formation.

In this experiment, the flow and flow gradient directions are perpendicular to the direction of the applied magnetic field. The scattering intensity is isotropic in zero-shear-rate or zero-applied-field conditions, indicating that the particles are randomly oriented. Anisotropic scattering is observed both in a shear flow and in a static magnetic field, showing that both flow and field induce orientational order in the dispersion. The anisotropy increases with the increase of field and with the increase of shear rate. Three states of order have been observed with the application of both shear flow and magnetic field. At low shear rates, the particles are aligned in the field direction. When increasing shear rate is applied, the particles revert to random orientations at a characteristic shear rate that depends on the strength of the applied magnetic field.

The interaction is, thus, entropically driven, exhibits enthalpy-entropy compensation, and increases the binding affinity of the RNA polymerase to the promoter by factors ranging from 1.7 ± 0.1 (cAMP-ligated S128A) to 6.1 ± 0.1 (cAMP-ligated CRP*). Although the binding affinities to the promoter alone, except for cAMP-ligated S128A, are the same as to a shorter 40 bp duplex containing the same CRP consensus binding site sequence (conDNA), the binding enthalpies of CRP/mutant to the promoter are lower by factors of 2-3× than the corresponding binding enthalpies to conDNA. Small angle neutron scattering measurements on the DNA-CRP/mutant complexes in D2O/H2O solutions exhibit an increase in the Rg of the CRP/mutant component from 22 to 27-31 Å that can be attributed to a conformational change in the N-terminal domain of CRP. The Rg = 27 Å for the bound conDNA can be attributed to a slight unwinding of the DNA in solution that would also enhance the activation of transcription. The Rg = 53 ± 3 Å for the bound promoter is attributed to bending of the promoter in solution that can be responsible for the lower CRP/mutant-promoter binding endothermicities."

PE/PIB and PE/PP chains are incompatible (the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter > 0), while PIB and PP are compatible ( < 0) at low temperatures and incompatible ( > 0) at high temperatures. These interactions lead to an order-disorder transition at 150 ± 5 C and macrophase separation at 251 ± 5 C. The nature of the concentration fluctuations in the homogeneous state (155 C < T < 246 C) was studied by comparing the experimentally determined SANS profiles with theoretical calculations based on the multicomponent random phase approximation (RPA). Order formation at low temperatures is driven by two parameters: PE/PIB and lPP (the statistical segment length of the PP block). The other temperature-dependent parameters drive the system away from the ordering transition. At high temperatures, the RPA predicts microphase separation, while experimental data (neutron and light scattering) indicate macrophase separation. This discrepancy is mainly due to the inability of the RPA to correctly account for the large length scale concentration fluctuations."

When the PE-PP copolymer is added to a 50/50 PE/PIB mixture, the resulting phase diagram in temperature-copolymer composition space exhibits many of the characteristics of \"fish-shaped\" phase diagrams found in oil/water mixtures stabilized by balanced surfactants. This is due to the interplay between the different parameters that characterize the system. Lamellar phases, single droplet microemulsions, and bicontinuous microemulsions were observed. The length scales of these structures and the locations of the phase transition points on the phase diagram determined by TEM and scattering are in reasonable agreement. Phase transitions from a lamellar phase to a single droplet microemulsion phase, and from a bicontinuous microemulsion to a macrophase-separated structure, have been identified."

The study was carried out on a solution of 1 wt % C8E5 in D2O at 29.4 C and pressures up to 310 MPa. The C8E5 micelles that form under these conditions are noninteracting. We find that applying pressure leads to a pronounced decrease in the micelle radius of gyration and the forward scattering intensity over the pressure range from ambient to 150 MPa. The partial molecular volume of the surfactant and the extent of hydration of the surfactant head groups in the micelle were also determined using the method of solvent contrast variation. Both quantities decrease with the application of pressure up to 150 MPa. Core-shell model fits to the scattering spectra over the entire q-range indicate that the shell radius decreases, while the hydrophobic core radius increases slightly with pressure. The pressure dependence of the shell radius is notably similar to that observed for the radius of gyration. Collectively, these observations lead to the conclusion that the effect of pressure on C8E5 micellization is to induce the dehydration of surfactant head groups and the collapse of the hydrophilic micelle shell at pressures between ambient and 150 MPa."

Micelle structural parameters were obtained by fitting the core-corona form factor and hard-sphere interaction structure factor to small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data obtained at contrast conditions where the solvents were fully deuterated and the copolymer was not. The siloxane copolymer forms in water at 20 C micelles that consist of a \"dry\" core with a radius of about 6 nm and a solvated (about 40% polymer) corona with a thickness of 2 nm; the relatively thin corona may be due to the comb-type architecture of the siloxane copolymer. The micelle radii, micelle core radii, micelle association numbers, and polymer volume fractions in the micelle core and corona decreased with increasing cosolvent/water ratio in the mixed solvents containing 2-propanol, ethanol, or formamide. On the contrary, the addition of glycerol led to an increase of the micelle association number. The above findings are discussed in terms of the relative location of the polar organic solvents in the interior or exterior of the siloxane copolymer micelles. In particular, the micelle association numbers observed for different water-cosolvent mixtures can be correlated to the octanol-water partition coefficients of the respective cosolvents. A transition from spherical to ellipsoid micelles was observed upon an increase in the temperature: this is attributed to the desolvation of the polyether chains. This structural transition correlates with the solvent quality in the mixed solvents: ethanol and 2-propanol, which solvate the interior of the micelles, tending to keep the micelles spherical, while increased glycerol content in the mixed solvent leads to the formation of ellipsoids at a fixed temperature."

Measurements indicate that the gelatin layer thickness increases to a maximum as a function of SDS concentration, while the volume fraction of gelatin adsorbed at the interface simultaneously decreases. Consequently, the adsorbed amount of gelatin peaks at SDS concentrations equivalent to approximately one SDS micelle/gelatin chain.

While the value of for PS star/linear blends increases monotonically with number of arms in the star, the value of in the PB star/linear blends does not, a result which cannot be anticipated by the Gaussian field theory (GFT) of Fredrickson et al.1 An important discrepancy between theory and experiment is also found for the variation of with linear chain length. Theory anticipates the value of should decrease with increasing linear chain size, but in fact it increases. Qualitative agreement with the GFT is found on two counts: decreases with increasing concentration of star (when assuming isotopic for linear/linear blends is constant with concentration), and decreases with increasing length of the star arm. In general, the value of for a PB blend of star and linear components is larger than the value of for a comparable PS blend.

Magnetic anisotropy has no influence on the magnetic small-angle neutron scattering when the particles are mobile, as is the case e.g. in ferrofluids, but, when the particles are embedded in a rigid non-magnetic matrix and the orientations of the anisotropy axes are fixed, significant deviations compared to the case of negligible anisotropy are expected.

For both systems, three different scattering patterns were observed corresponding to distinct structural phases at specific temperatures and lipid concentrations. At 45 C and a lipid concentration of >0.05 g/mL, the high-viscosity liquid crystalline phase was found to be a perforated and possibly undulating lamellar phase consistent with NMR results. Upon dilution (<0.05 g/mL) at the same temperature (45 C), the perforated lamellar phase transformed into a unilamellar vesicular phase, in which the bilayers may also be perforated. Below about 25 C, the viscosity decreases considerably and the scattering data suggest that the lamellae present at higher temperatures break up into smaller entities characterized by the bicellar morphology proposed previously for the nondoped system. The structural dimensions of the vesicular and bicellar phases have been determined as a function of lipid concentrations from the SANS data. In the lamellar phase, the influence of Tm3+ ions and DMPG on bilayer structure (e.g., lamellar repeat spacing, bilayer rigidity, and magnetic alignment) were also investigated."

This study utilized an external polymer concentration, cfree, well into the overlapped or semidilute regime. Analysis of the experimental data using the standard bulk analysis procedure yields the surprising result that the chain dimensions in the pore are the same as in the unconfined solution. Since simulation results for comparable physical situations, which suggest that chains expand when they are strongly confined, are not in agreement with this interpretation, we conclude that our analysis misses some aspect of the experimental situations. To reconcile this discrepancy between theory and experimental results, we utilize the facts that the chains are strongly confined in one direction by the pore walls and that the pores are themselves random walks rather than straight cylindrical objects. A reanalysis of the experimental data on this basis then shows that chain dimensions in the pores are swollen relative to an unconfined chain, in a manner that is in agreement with the recent simulations of van Giessen and Szleifer. While these results provide the first quantitative tests of these simulation results, we nevertheless conclude that the random nature of the pore geometry in Vycor makes the conclusions drawn very subject to the particular models employed in the analysis of experimental data."

Upon transition into the constrained phase, aggregation of PPE molecules into large flat clusters occurs.

In low salt buffer, the RNA was expanded, with an average radius of gyration (Rg) of 53 ± 1 Å. A highly cooperative transition to a compact form (Rg = 31.5 ± 0.5 Å) was observed between 1.6 and 1.7 mM MgCl2. The collapse transition, which is unusually sharp in Mg2+, has the characteristics of a first-order phase transition. Partial digestion with ribonuclease T1 under identical conditions showed that this transition correlated with the assembly of double helices in the ribozyme core. Fivefold higher Mg2+ concentrations were required for self-splicing, indicating that compaction occurs before native tertiary interactions are fully stabilized. No further decrease in Rg was observed between 1.7 and 20 mM MgCl2, indicating that the intermediates have the same dimensions as the native ribozyme, within the uncertainty of the data (±1 Å). A more gradual transition to a final Rg of approximately 33.5 Å was observed between 0.45 and 2 M NaCl.

Our measurements show that this dextrose added to the extensively studied CPCl/hexanol/brine system is taken up exclusively by the brine solvent, resulting in an equivalent CPCl/hexanol membrane structure and phase behavior for this modified system. Adding dextrose to the brine in these systems to volume fractions up to 0.4 allows us to increase the solvent viscosity by more than an order of magnitude. This lowers the cooperative membrane diffusion coefficient in this system as measured by dynamic light scattering by the same factor, resulting in a corresponding slowing of the Helfrich fluctuation dominated membrane dynamics. Our results show clear and consistent evidence of shear-induced sponge to lamellar phase transformations in these systems. Further, both the rheological and microstructural responses of these systems follow universal master curves when plotted against a rescaled applied shear s/3, where is the membrane volume fraction and s is the viscosity of the brine/dextrose solvent. This well-defined shear response is characterized by three distinct regimes. At low shear rates the sponge phases exhibit Newtonian flow behavior and no structural change is observed. For intermediate shear rates, the systems shear thin and SANS measurements show that the sponge phases are progressively transformed into lamellar phases with the CPCl/hexanol membrane normals aligned parallel to the velocity gradient. This continuous process and the absence of a stress plateau in the rheological measurements both rule out the existence of a biphasic state in this region and thus of a first-order transition between sponge and lamellar phases as is observed in equilibrium phase diagrams. At higher shear rates, the systems are apparently again Newtonian, but the induced lamellar phase appears to collapse and a new (and as yet unidentified) large-scale structure forms. We have found these systems to be extremely sensitive to evaporation, and reproducibility of the scattering measurements required the use of a Couette shear cell with a specially designed vapor barrier."

Both field emission scanning electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering confirm the presence of porosity with a diameter of approximately 3.4 nm. This is the smallest porosity quantitatively reported from a de-alloying process to date. The small size is attributed to the extremely small values of surface diffusivity expected for Pt at room temperature, effectively eliminating room-temperature coarsening processes. The results also show that larger length scales can be achieved through coarsening at elevated temperatures.

The high viscosities reflect the growth of giant, entangled wormlike micelles in the solutions. Mixtures of NaOA with a shorter-chain analogue (C6TAB) have much lower viscosities, indicating a weak micellar growth and hence a weak attraction between the surfactants. On the other hand, increasing the CnTAB tail length to n = 10 or 12 leads to much stronger interactions between these surfactants and NaOA. Consequently, both micellar and bilayer structures are formed in these mixtures, and the samples separate into two or more phases over a wide composition range. Thus, the synergistic growth of wormlike micelles in cationic/anionic mixtures is maximized when there is an optimal asymmetry in the surfactant tail lengths."

CO2 was a poor solvent for both polymers and exhibited very weak selectivity between the blend components. The sorption of modest concentrations of CO2, at pressures up to 160 bar, induced phase segregation at temperatures well below the binary-phase-separation temperature and caused an increased asymmetry in the lower critical solution temperature curve. The origin of solvent-induced phase segregation in this weakly interacting polymer blend system was attributed predominantly to an exacerbation of the existing disparity in the compressibility of the components upon CO2 sorption."

An elusive goal in this research field has been the ability to predict or simulate the degree of thermodynamic compatibility of two distinct homopolymers based on pure component properties alone. In an attempt to address this need, we present a simple model for the free energy of mixing of compressible polymer blends, based on a modification of the regular solution model. Its ability to qualitatively capture the phase behavior of weakly interacting polymer pairs using only the pure component properties of mass density, solubility parameter, and thermal expansion coefficient is demonstrated. To this end, a wide range of blend chemistries is considered, spanning purely dispersive polyolefin systems to those comprising more polar components, such as poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(-caprolactone), and polycarbonate. The thermodynamic and molecular origin of the observed phase behavior for each of the systems studied is also discussed."

Here we report the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the phase behavior of the same series of block copolymers, as determined by in situ small-angle neutron scattering. We find that hydrostatic pressure is a very effective means of driving styrene/n-alkyl methacrylate block copolymers with intermediate side chains from the highly viscous ordered state to the fluid disordered state of the copolymer. Hence, for n ranging from 2 to 6 (ethyl to hexyl methacrylate), pressure induces mixing with an absolute value of the pressure coefficient of the order/disorder transition, dTODT/dP, of up to 1.5 C/MPa (150 C/kbar). Similar results are obtained when the methacrylate block consists of a random sequence of short and long alkyl side chains with carefully chosen and predictable composition. In contrast, pressure suppresses mixing when the methacrylate block is composed of either very short (n = 1) or very long (n > 8) side chains. In terms of rheological properties, these results indicate that pressure applied at a constant temperature can be used to induce flow in some copolymers of this series. The ability to design such \"baroplastic\" behavior into commercially relevant thermoplastic elastomers would be highly advantageous from a processing standpoint."

At both pH and pD 7.0 and above, the tubulin polymers are seen to be predominantly microtubules. Although in H2O buffer the polymer distribution is little changed as the pH varies, when pD is lowered the samples appear to contain an appreciable amount of sheetlike structures and the average microtubule protofilament number increases from ca. 12.5 at pD 7.0 to ca. 14 at pD 6.0.

SANS was used to measure the shear-induced orientation of polymer and platelets. With increasing shear rate an anisotropic scattering pattern developed. At higher shear rates, the scattering anisotropy increased due to the enhanced orientation of the clay platelets in the shear field. The clay platelets aligned by the flow in an unusual direction, with the surface normal parallel to the vorticity direction. SANS on regular samples (contrast between D2O and solution components) measured the shear-induced orientation of polymer and platelets. However, with contrast matching the orientation of the polymer alone could be detected.

Here, we present small-angle neutron-scattering results to evaluate the influence of C24 wax in the presence of the PEB random copolymer upon the self-assembly event.

These diblock polymers self-assemble in oil to form expansive platelike aggregates consisting of a PE core cloaked behind the amorphous PEP brush layer. The PE core thus promotes nucleation of solubilized long chain alkanes. Additional candidate structures for wax crystal nucleators include linear and star copolyolefins where the composition variation signals the alteration between crystalline and amorphous segments. This study focuses upon the self-assembling behavior in solution of these materials. The characteristics of the single chains and the aggregates formed at lower temperatures were determined via small-angle neutron scattering. Both plates and needlelike structures were found. The placement of the amorphous and crystalline blocks in the arms of the star shaped polymers was found to influence the architecture of the self-assembled micelles.

The total surfactant concentration in each of the five samples studied is fixed at 0.01 M in isooctane. The water content is fixed at Wt = 20 (Wt = moles water/moles total surfactant). The molar ratios of lecithin to AOT are 0, 1:7, 1:3, 3:5, and 1:1 in the five samples, respectively. The experimental SANS data from all five samples are fit well by a model containing polydispersed spheres. The mean size of the spheres increases, whereas the polydispersity decreases as the lecithin content is increased. The different packing parameters for AOT and lecithin drive the observed changes in droplet size, whereas the reduction in polydispersity is a consequence of the increased rigidity of the interface as lecithin is added. An alternate morphology, consisting of prolate ellipsoids, also produces good fits to the SANS data. For this model, the ellipsoid volume increases, whereas the ratio of the major to minor axis goes toward unity as the lecithin content is increased. Radii of gyration obtained from fits in the Guinier/Zimm region match calculations from the droplet dimensions produced by fitting the complete scattering profiles. For lecithin/AOT molar ratios of 3/5 and 1, SANS measurements reveal that an attractive interaction develops between these droplets. The interdroplet interaction is described using a square well potential model. Fits to the SANS data give well depths of 0.022 and 0.126 kT, whereas the widths are 538 and 450 Å, respectively.

The addition of water to a solution of AOT and lecithin in isooctane leads to a dramatic increase in viscosity and the formation of a rigid gel as the water content is increased above a specific threshold. SANS profiles indicate that these gels have a crystalline microstructure with characteristic dimensions that are clearly correlated to the system's water content and temperature.

Solubility profiles of the asphaltenes and their subfractions indicated strong cooperative asphaltene interactions of a particular subfraction that is polar and hydrogen bonding. This subfraction had lower H/C ratios and modestly higher N, V, Ni, and Fe contents than the less polar and more soluble subfraction of asphaltenes. VPO and SANS studies indicated that the less soluble subfractions formed aggregates that were considerably larger than the more soluble subfractions. In general, asphaltene aggregate size increased with decreasing solvent aromaticity up to the solubility limit, beyond which the aggregate size decreased with heptane addition. The presence of a low wavevector Q feature in the scattering curves at 25 °C indicated that the individual aggregates were flocculating; however, the intensity of the feature was diminished upon heating of the samples to 80 °C. The solubility mechanism for Canadon Seco asphaltenes, the largest aggregate formers, appears to be dominated by aromatic -bonding interactions due to their low H/C ratio and low nitrogen content. B6 and Hondo asphaltenes formed similar-sized aggregates in heptol and the solubility mechanism is most likely driven by polar interactions due to their relatively high H/C ratios and high nitrogen contents. Arab Heavy, the least polar asphaltene, had a H/C ratio similar to Canadon Seco but formed the smallest aggregates in heptol. The enhancement in polar and -bonding interactions for the less soluble subfraction indicated by elemental analysis is reflected by the aggregate size from SANS. The less soluble asphaltenes contribute the majority of species responsible for aggregation and likely cause many petroleum production problems such as pipeline deposition and water-in-oil emulsion stabilization."

Solubility profiles generated in the presence of resins (1:1 mass ratio) indicated the onset of asphaltene precipitation occurred at lower toluene volume fractions (0.10.2) than without resins. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) was performed on solutions of asphaltene fractions in mixtures of heptane and toluene with added resins to determine aggregate sizes. Water-in-oil emulsions of asphalteneresin solutions were prepared and separated by a centrifuge method to determine the vol.% water resolved. In general, the addition of resins to asphaltenes reduced the aggregate size by disrupting the  and polar bonding interactions between asphaltene monomers. Interaction of resins with asphaltenic aggregates rendered the aggregates less interfacially active and thus reduced emulsion stability. The smallest aggregate sizes observed and the weakest emulsion stability at high resin to asphaltene (R/A) ratios presumably corresponded to asphaltenic monomers or small oligomers strongly interacting with resin molecules. It was often observed that, in the absence of resins, the more polar or higher molecular weight asphaltenes were insoluble in solutions of heptane and toluene. The addition of resins dissolved these insolubles and aggregate size by SANS increased until the solubility limit was reached. This corresponded approximately to the point of maximum emulsion stability. Asphaltene chemistry plays a vital role in dictating emulsion stability. The most polar species typically required significantly higher resin concentrations to disrupt asphaltene interactions and completely destabilize emulsions. Aggregation and film formation are likely driven by polar heteroatom interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which allow asphaltenes to absorb, consolidate, and form cohesive films at the oilwater interface."

The microemulsion consists of a ternary blend of poly(ethyl ethylene) (PEE), poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS), and a PEEPDMS diblock copolymer. At equilibrium, the microemulsion contains two percolating microphases, one PEE rich and the other PDMS rich, separated by a copolymer-laden interface; the characteristic length scale of this structure is 80 nm. Low strain amplitude oscillatory shear measurements reveal behavior similar to that of block copolymer lamellar phases just above the orderdisorder transition. Steady shear experiments expose four distinct regimes of response as a function of the shear rate. At low shear rates (regime I) Newtonian behavior is observed, whereas at intermediate shear rates (regime II) development of anisotropy in the morphology leads to shear thinning. When the shear rate is further increased, there is an abrupt breakdown of the bicontinuous structure, resulting in flow-induced phase separation (regime III). Rheological measurements indicate that the shear stress is almost independent of the shear rate in this regime. Light scattering reveals a streak-like pattern, and correspondingly a string-like morphology with micron dimensions is observed with video microscopy. Upon a further increase of the shear rate (regime IV), the sample resembles an immiscible binary polymer blend with the block copolymer playing no significant role; the stress increases strongly with the shear rate. In some respects these results resemble those from other weakly structured complex fluids (sponge phases, liquid crystals, worm-like micelles, block copolymers, polymer blends, and polymer solutions), yet in important ways this system is unique."

This is accomplished through a systematic study of the influence of increasing NaCl concentration on the dilute aqueous micellar system of 11 mM cetyltrimethylammonium p-toluenesulfonate (CTAT). Concurrent with increases in the zero-shear viscosity (o), low NaCl concentrations lead to the growth of micelles through increases in the degree of screening of electrostatic interactions. These systems, which exhibit discernible electrostatic or correlation peaks in the SANS results, undergo shear-induced structural transitions, whereby critical shear rates tend to increase with NaCl concentration. With further increases in the NaCl concentration, intermicellar electrostatic interactions are adequately screened, and no SIS is observed. The addition of NaCl to these systems increases the micellar flexibility, as shown by SLS. The o of these systems decreases, and the critical shear rates for these shear-thinning systems increases, consistent with expectations for dilute polyelectrolyte systems."

The blends exhibit lower critical solution temperature behavior (LCST), and the LCST increases with increasing sulfonation level of the ionomer. When the sulfonation level of the ionomer was below 20 mol %, a peak was observed in the scattering structure factor. The position of the peak moved to lower wavevector with increasing sulfonation level and with increasing temperature. The origin of the peak was a correlation hole due to the essential formation of a graft copolymer by the formation of an ion-dipole complex between the amide and sulfonate groups. The tendency of the unsulfonated polystyrene to phase separate from the polyamide was suppressed by the complexation, but it also produced large concentration fluctuations in the blends. The size and intensity of the concentration fluctuations increased with increasing temperature, i.e., as the LCST phase boundary was approached, and decreased with increasing sulfonation level as the length of the unsulfonated chain between sulfonate groups (and complex sites) decreased. The SANS data were successfully modeled with a modified form of the de Gennes model for scattering from a cross-linked polymer blend, which allowed for calculation of an interaction parameter, , for the system.

One, polystyrene-block-poly(n-hexyl methacrylate), P(S-b-nHMA), exhibits an order-disorder transition (ODT), whereas the other, polystyrene-block-poly(n-butyl methacrylate), P(S-b-nBMA), exhibits a lower disorder-order transition (LDOT). CO2 sorption increases miscibility of the segments in P(S-b-nHMA) slightly: the ODT is depressed by less than 7 C at a CO2 fluid density of 0.25 g/cm3, which corresponds to 7 vol % dilation of the copolymer with CO2 at the conditions studied. In contrast, CO2 sorption decreased the miscibility of P(S-b-nBMA) markedly: the LDOT was depressed by more than 70 C at densities < 0.06 g/cm3, which corresponds to less than 3 vol % sorption of CO2. Unlike P(S-b-nHMA), ordering transitions in CO2-dilated P(S-b-nBMA) exhibit a pronounced thermal hysteresis that increases with increasing volume fraction of sorbed diluent. The hysteresis is a consequence of the sensitivity of the LDOT system to differences in CO2 sorption between the ordered and disordered states, as evidenced by neutron reflectivity measurements. The difference in the effect of CO2 sorption on the phase behavior of the copolymers is attributed to the different nature of the transitions. The entropically driven LDOT is depressed by differential dilation of the copolymer domains, which increases both the compressibility of the system and disparities in compressibility between the blocks. In contrast, the enthalpically driven ODT is depressed by the screening of segmental interactions by CO2 and is less sensitive to compressibility."

In this paper, these coatings are characterized using two distinctly different approaches, both based on novel experimental techniques and computational modeling tools. In each approach, detailed finite element models are illustrated to represent the porous coatings fabricated with four different types of zirconia feed powder. One approach is based on small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) studies carried out to quantify microstructure. In this approach, the pore morphology is idealized by artificially rebuilding, based on the collective microstructural information obtained in terms of component porosities of three pore systems, their opening dimensions and orientation. The other method relies on image analysis of real microstructural images obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The finite element mesh for the actual cross-sectional model, generated by thresholding the SEM images, is constructed with the object oriented finite (OOF) element method. Through these two approaches, the effective thermal conductivity and elastic modulus along the spray, as well as the transverse directions are estimated for thermally sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia (PSZ) coatings. Our results show the effectiveness of these computational approaches for estimating material properties with each approach having its strength and weakness. However, in comparison with experimentally measured properties, there exist some limitations in both approaches. To further probe the source of discrepancy within the measurements, the coatings are thermal cycled to reduce the effect of splat boundaries on properties. Additional models are constructed for these coatings and their analysis is carried out. For the first time, the influence of the splat interfaces on the effective properties of sprayed coatings is quantified."

This is in addition to the known glass-forming mechanism due to the cage effect in the hard sphere system (the repulsive glass). The calculations also indicate that if the range of attraction is sufficiently short compared to the diameter of the particle, within a certain interval of volume fractions where the two glass-forming mechanisms nearly balance each other, varying the external control parameter, the effective temperature, makes the glass-to-liquid-to-glass reentrance and the glass-to-glass transitions possible. Here we present experimental evidence of both transitions, obtained from small-angle neutron-scattering and photon correlation measurements taken from dense L64 copolymer micellar solutions in heavy water. Varying the temperature in certain predicted volume fraction range triggers a sharp transition between these two different types of glass. In particular, according to MCT, there is an end point (called A3 singularity) of this glass-to-glass transition line, beyond which the long-time dynamics of the two glasses become identical. Our findings confirm this theoretical prediction. Surprisingly, although the Debye-Waller factors, the long-time limit of the coherent intermediate scattering functions, of these two glasses obtained from photon correlation measurements indeed become identical at the predicted volume fraction, they exhibit distinctly different intermediate time relaxation. Furthermore, our experimental results obtained from volume fractions beyond the end point are characterized by the same features as the repulsive glass obtained before the end point. A complete phase diagram giving the boundaries of the structural arrest transitions for L64 micellar system is given."

The paper explores a method for analyzing field-dependent SANS data from such materials in terms of a model based on the theory of micromagnetics. Samples of cw Ni and of electrodeposited nc Ni and nc Co were characterized by x-ray scattering and magnetometry, and were investigated by SANS both with and without polarization of the neutron beam. The variation of the differential scattering cross section with the scattering vector and with the applied magnetic field is well described by the model. Also, experimental results for the exchange stiffness constant A and for the spin-wave stiffness constant D obtained from the analysis are found to agree with literature data obtained by inelastic neutron scattering on single-crystal specimens. The model supplies an \"anisotropy field scattering function\" that contains information on the magnitude of the magnetic anisotropy in the material, and on the characteristic length scales on which the anisotropy changes direction. The results suggest that the anisotropy may be strongly nonuniform in each crystallite, possibly due to twinning, and that some magnetic moments in the Ni samples are strongly pinned at defects."

Tensile properties of ePP were compared to its solvent fractions, and the role of each solvent fraction residing within ePP was investigated by blending 5 wt % deuterated fraction with ePP. The tensile properties of each fraction vary considerably, exhibiting properties from a weak gum elastomer for ES, to a semicrystalline thermoplastic for HI. The intermediate tacticity HS fraction exhibits elastic properties similar to the parent elastomer (ePP). In the melt at 160 C, SANS shows that all deuterated fractions are homogeneously mixed with ePP. Slow cooling from the melt to 25 C causes the low tacticity fraction to preferentially segregate in amorphous domains due to different crystallization temperatures and kinetics although, despite its low crystallinity (2%), the low tacticity fraction can cocrystallize with the matrix. The dES-ePP shows little or no relaxation when held under strain and recovers readily upon the release of stress. The high tacticity component (dHI-ePP) retains its plastic properties in the blend."

We examine this assumption on melittin by using two methods, oriented circular dichroism (OCD) for detecting the orientation of melittin helix and neutron scattering for detecting transmembrane pores. OCD spectra of melittin were systematically measured. Melittin can orient either perpendicularly or parallel to a lipid bilayer, depending on the physical condition and the composition of the bilayer. Transmembrane pores were detected when the helices oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the bilayers, not when the helices oriented parallel to the bilayers. The evidence that led to the barrel-stave model for alamethicin and that to the toroidal model for magainin were reviewed. The properties of melittin pores are closely similar to that of magainin but unlike that of alamethicin. We conclude that, among naturally produced peptides that we have investigated, only alamethicin conforms to the barrel-stave model. Other peptides, including magainins, melittin and protegrins, all appear to induce transmembrane pores that conform to the toroidal model in which the lipid monolayer bends continuously through the pore so that the water core is lined by both the peptides and the lipid headgroups."

Membranes swollen up to approximately 50 vol % solvent exhibited two scattering maxima, one known to be associated with ionic regions of the membrane structure and one known to be associated with correlation distances between crystalline regions in the membrane structure. The positions of both maxima shifted toward lower scattering vector values as the solvent content in the membrane increased.

The Bragg spacings corresponding to both the ionic-feature scattering maximum and the crystalline-feature scattering maximum were plotted versus the solvent volume fraction in the membranes, and the data fit with linear regression.

While a model with homogeneous density profiles in the core and shell, respectively, and with a size distribution (a polydisperse coreshell model) also fits the data comparably well, the extra parameters required for this fit are difficult to justify on the basis of the data. In addition, unconstrained fits using the coreshell model failed to converge to values of the overall molecular size and molecular weight which agreed with values determined from independent light scattering measurements which leads to the conclusion that the power law model is a more appropriate function for describing the radial density function of these molecules. The density profile from either model showed that the polystyrene core of the molecules is not collapsed. Values of the second virial coefficient, A2, have been calculated from Zimm plots and it was found that A2 decreased as a function of generation to close to zero for the highest generation (i.e. highest molecular weight) polymers.

Deuterated polystyrene (DPS) and dithranol in tetrahydrofuran were deposited by electrospray onto a substrate for small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements. DPS with 6050 and 27 000 g mol-1 molecular masses were prepared at mass fractions between 0.2 and 6%. All samples contained large aggregates of DPS with characteristic sizes >200 Å that represent hundreds of aggregated chains. Samples of mass fraction 1% DPS (6050 g mol-1) in 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, and sinapinic acid also have large zero angle scattering characteristic of large aggregates. The morphological trend obtained from the SANS measurements of the DPS aggregate size in the four matrixes is dithranol > 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid > all-trans-retinoic acid > sinapinic acid. These measurements indicate that DPS in dithranol exhibits the most strong phase separation, while DPS in sinapinic acid shows considerable domain mixing. All of these matrixes produce MALDI signal strength under appropriate conditions, suggesting that strong phase separation does not diminish the signal-to-noise ratio. DPS (188 000 g mol-1) in biphenyl was used as a model system of a matrix that can be either crystalline or amorphous. SANS data shows that above the biphenyl melting point, a conventional solution is formed that has molecularly dispersed polymers. Upon crystallization, there is strong aggregation of the DPS into large domains. Therefore, the crystalline matrixes commonly used in MALDI measurements probably cause large aggregations of polymers to be present during the MALDI process.

A glass of TNB is obtained upon heating above the crystalline melting point with a glass transition temperature of 68 ± 2 °C having no remaining crystallinity. MALDI samples containing mass fraction 1% polystyrene (PS) are run in both the crystalline and amorphous states. In the crystalline state, there is a strong spectrum typical of PS, but upon melting and quenching to the glassy state, the MALDI signal disappears. If the transparent, amorphous sample is treated with 1-butanol, it becomes white, and the MALDI signal returns. DSC shows that the 1-butanol treatment leads to the return of some of the crystallinity.

In its membrane-bound form it functions as the motor component of the protein translocase, perhaps through successive rounds of membrane insertion and ATP hydrolysis. To understand both the energy conversion process and translocase assembly, we have used contrast-matched, small-angle neutron-scattering (SANS) experiments to examine SecA in small unilamellar vesicles of E. coli phospholipids. In the absence of nucleotide, we observe a dimeric form of SecA with a radius of gyration comparable to that previously observed for SecA in solution. In contrast, the presence of either ADP or a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog induces conversion to a monomeric form. The larger radius of gyration for the ATP-bound relative to the ADP-bound form suggests the former has a more expanded global conformation. This is the first direct structural determination of SecA in a lipid bilayer. The SANS data indicate that nucleotide turnover can function as a switch of conformation of SecA in the membrane in a manner consistent with its proposed role in successive cycles of deep membrane penetration and release with concommitant preprotein insertion."

After subtracting a viscous background contribution from the pure constituents, the microemulsion exhibits \"excess\" viscoelastic behavior similar in character to that resulting from the Rouse model of polymer dynamics. The data are compared to the predictions of a time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg model developed by Pätzold and Dawson, using structural parameters derived from neutron scattering as input. This model captures the essential characteristics of the viscoelastic behavior very well. However, using independent dynamic light scattering measurements of the Onsager coefficient for these blends, it appears that the model fails to predict either the magnitude or the temperature dependence of the zero shear viscosity and relaxation time of the microemulsion accurately. Possible origins for these discrepancies are discussed."

The comb polymer was blended with six linear PEExx copolymers, all of which had MW 60 kg/mol and EE percentages ranging from 55 to 90%; they were denoted L55 to L90, with the number referring to the percentage of EE repeat units. The second series consisted of linear/linear blends; the first component, with MW = 220 kg/mol and 90% EE, was denoted L90A, and the second components were the same series of linear polymers, with MW 60 kg/mol and various EE compositions. The concentrations investigated were 50/50 w/w, except for the blend of branched B90 and linear L90 (both components were 90% EE), for which 25/75 and 75/25 concentrations were also examined. The SANS results indicated that for the comb/linear blends, only the dB90/L90 blends were miscible, whereas the other five blends phase-separated; for the linear/linear blends, dL90A/L83 and dL90A/L78 were miscible, whereas the other three blends were immiscible.

The molecules are designed to exploit the incompatibilities of their three molecular parts, and the results demonstrate that this strategy can be used to tune molecular aggregation and gel stability. The gelating properties of these LMOGs have been examined in a wide variety of organic liquids (including alkanes, alcohols, toluene, n-perfluorooctane, CCl4, and DMSO) as a function of the N-alkyl and perfluoroalkyl chain lengths by X-ray diffraction, polarizing optical microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The gels are thermally reversible and require generally very low concentrations (<2 wt %) of LMOG. Several of the gels are stable for very long periods at room temperature. The incompatibility of the fluorocarbon and hydrocarbon segments causes the LMOGs to aggregate, probably into lamellae within the fibrils that constitute the basic unit of the gel networks. The SANS studies show that the cross-sections of fibers in the gel networks of LMOGs with shorter perfluoroalkyl chains are much larger than those with longer ones. Comparisons with the gelating properties of some analogous esters (F(CF2)nCO2(CH2)mH) and diblock perfluoroalkylalkanes (F(CF2)n(CH2)mH) indicate that additional ordering within the aggregate units is enforced by the intermolecular H bonding among amide groups that is evidenced by IR spectroscopy.

While the initial dendrimers have a spherical structure with a collapsed core, solubilization of metal salt hydrate leads to the formation of cylindrical multidendrimer structures with swollen, metal-salt-filled dendrimer cores. The cylindrical structure can be deduced from the small-angle neutron (SANS) as well as from the X-ray scattering (SAXS) pair distance distribution function. While the neutron scattering leads to a two-step cross-sectional density profile, the X-ray scattering is sensitive only to the metal-salt-stained core. The gold salt inside the dendrimers was reduced to form colloidal particles, and upon reduction the cylindrical structure breaks up and spherical colloids are formed. The sizes are larger than would be expected if the gold salt loading of one dendrimer formed one particle, indicating that the ions from several dendrimers are combined. These dendrimer-stabilized metal colloids represent hybrid structures that have potential importance as selective catalysts and in the formation of composite materials with special optical properties."

In this regard, recently layered silicate nanocomposites have been shown to be effective in modifying the polymer properties because of their high surface area of contact between the polymer and the high aspect ratio nanoparticle. Potential property enhancements should also occur in polymer nanocomposite thin films owing to nanoparticle orientation from film confinement effects. In this paper we investigate the effect of layered silicate nanoparticles on the phase behavior of a classic polymer blend using small angle neutron scattering and compare those results to phase diagrams obtained by high throughput combinatorial methods."

The molecular weights and compositions were chosen to emphasize the region of the phase prism dominated by the bicontinuous microemulsion (BµE) phase; the homopolymer molecular weights and volume fractions were approximately equal. The SANS intensity was compared quantitatively with the TeubnerStrey structure factor, and interpreted via the amphiphilicity factor fa. The transition from a fully disordered mixture at higher temperatures to a well-developed BµE upon cooling did not correlate well with either the disorder line (fa = +1) or the total monomer Lifshitz line (fa = 0). However, DLS provided a clear signature of this transition, via a distinct maximum in the temperature dependence of the dynamic correlation length. We hypothesize that this maximum is closely correlated to the homopolymer/homopolymer Lifshitz line. The structure of the interfaces in the BµE was further examined in terms of the curvature and the copolymer coverage, as functions of copolymer concentration and temperature."

For larger chains, at low filler concentrations, an increase in chain dimensions relative to the unfilled chain dimensions is observed. Both results are in agreement with existing Monte Carlo predictions. However, at even higher filler contents, which are beyond the scope of the Monte Carlo predictions, the chain dimensions reach a maximum value before decreasing to values which are still larger than the unfilled chain dimensions. A simple excluded volume model is proposed which accounts for these observations at higher filler content."

The polymer chains are in dynamic adsorption/desorption equilibrium with the clay particles to form a \"network\". The elastic behavior of the network was characterized by constant stress, oscillatory shear, and stress relaxation experiments. Constant stress experiments indicated a yield stress upon which shear flow started and no strain recovery could be observed. Oscillatory shear experiments showed a broad elastic region followed by flow when a critical strain was reached. Stress relaxation experiments showed several relaxation times when the same critical strain was reached. Experiments under steady flow characterized the transient behavior of the network. With increasing steady shear rate a pronounced minimum in birefringence was observed at a critical shear rate. The shear rate dependent viscosity showed near power law behavior and no corresponding critical feature. While birefringence detects orientational effects on a microscopic length scale, rheology averages over macroscopic changes in the sample. The same degree of orientation could be achieved under constant shear rate or constant stress conditions."

In binary blends and in ternary blends with lower content of the diblock copolymer, we have observed critical divergence of dynamic and static correlation lengths and of static susceptibility, as measured by dynamic light scattering and small-angle neutron scattering. The critical divergence for the binary blends could be analyzed in terms of a crossover between a mean-field and a nonclassical, Ising-type critical behavior. For ternary blends, the addition of a block copolymer stabilizes the system by decreasing the extent of composition fluctuations and by lowering the critical temperature. At a particular composition of the ternary blend, the appearance of a bicontinuous microemulsion was established by small-angle neutron scattering. It was shown that a maximum in the dynamic correlation length derived from dynamic light scattering and observed under these conditions is a characteristic signature of the microemulsion structure."

When subjected to a large amplitude reciprocating shear strain ( = ±600%) in the ordered lamellae state, the sample rapidly aligns in a perpendicular orientation with long-range order. The order-disorder transition temperature TODT() decreases with increasing shear rate , such that a shear rate of = 7 ± 1 s-1 is sufficient to disorder the material nearly 30 C below the quiescent TODT. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) from the sheared disordered state displays a symmetry that suggests a fundamentally different influence of shear compared to earlier observations of shear-induced anisotropy in the disordered states of lamellae forming diblock and triblock copolymers. Abrupt cessation of shear leads to spontaneous lamellar ordering into a macroscopically well-aligned transverse orientation-an arrangement that previously has been inaccessible via processing. In contrast to this behavior, the perpendicular alignment forms when cooling the sample from above the TODT while applying low shear rates, similar to the response of di- and triblock copolymers.

The two copolymers have total molecular weights of 24 400 and 23 900 and PDMS volume fractions of 0.12 and 0.10, respectively. The latter copolymer was obtained by extensive fractionation of the former, the difference in composition arising primarily from the removal of traces of PDMS homopolymer. The order-disorder transition (ODT) is unambiguously identified by rheology and SAXS. Above the ODT the SANS and rheological properties are consistent with the recently proposed disordered micelle regime, whereby the copolymers are associated in micellar aggregates that are not ordered on a lattice. The viscosity of the melt in this regime is greater than that of a poly(ethylenepropylene) homopolymer of the same total molecular weight. The SANS structure factors were analyzed by a generalized inverse Fourier transform and by direct fitting to a model based on the Percus-Yevick structure factor and either a spherical or an ellipsoidal form factor. Both approaches give comparable results, and the average micelle core radius, effective hard-sphere radius, and volume fraction were extracted as a function of temperature. The fitting suggests that as temperature increases the micelles remain relatively unchanged, but their number density and volume fraction decrease steadily. The fractionated copolymer has a significantly smaller micellar core than its precursor and therefore a significantly smaller aggregation number. These differences are attributable to the partitioning of PDMS homopolymer into the micellar cores. For these samples the critical micelle temperature (cmt), where the volume fraction of micelles should become negligible, was not accessed, even 100 deg above the ODT."

Neutron reflectivity (NR) was used to study the interfacial structure. The results are complemented by scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and lateral force microscopy (LFM), which were used to probe the morphology and surface lateral force. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) was used to characterize the size and surface properties of the filler aggregates in elastomers. Our results show that the interfacial behavior of PB/BIMS is more sensitive to carbon black than to silica. The interfacial broadening is significantly slowed down with addition of merely CB = 0.01 (volume fraction) carbon black fillers. This volume level is much lower than that used in bulk rubbers (CB 0.1). Pyrogeneous silica has a less pronounced effect on the interfacial characteristics. When both carbon and silica are incorporated into the PB layer, the effect of carbon black is offset by silica fillers."

It is confirmed that the filtration of solutions removes the clustering structure and that a steady-state amount of PEO in clusters is reformed in filtered solutions within 24 h. Adding a drop of chloroform to unfiltered aqueous solutions of PEO temporarily alters the clustering structure, but it prevents the clustering of PEO in filtered solutions. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Materials science"	"Ceramics"	"The microstructures of thermally sprayed coatings are very complex and incorporate process-dependent defects such as globular pores, interlamellar pores, cracks (in case of ceramics), etc. Porosity is a prevalent feature in the microstructure and affects a wide range of coating properties such as elastic modulus, thermal conductivity and dielectric behavior. Various methods are employed for quantitative measurement of porosity, which forms an important and integral part of microstructural characterization of thermal spray coatings. Studies have been conducted here to establish image analysis (IA) as a reliable method for characterization of porosity in thermally sprayed coatings. The versatility of IA methods for microstructural quantification has been investigated for diverse coatings deposited with distinct spray processes and material feedstock characteristics. The IA methods put forth have been successfully applied to a variety of thermally sprayed coatings; materials of interest in this study being produced from partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ, ZrO2+8% Y2O3) and alumina ceramics. The results have been complemented with the microstructural information obtained using advanced characterization techniques, such as small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and computer micro-tomography (CMT) carried out on similar coatings. The trends shown by these different methods for variation in porosity with respect to feedstock characteristics were in agreement. This study confirms the applicability of image analysis as a straightforward, versatile, reliable and inexpensive method for the characterization of porosity."

SANS data from the one-phase region approaching the phase boundary has been acquired for blends modified by random and diblock copolymers that have equal amounts of styrene and butadiene monomers as well as a random copolymer with an unequal monomer composition. The binary blend is near the critical composition, and the copolymer concentrations are low at 2.5% (w/w). The data have been fitted with the random-phase approximation model (binary and multicomponent versions) to obtain Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (chi) for the various monomer interactions. These results are considered in the context of previous light scattering data for the same blend systems. The SANS cloud points are in good agreement with previous results from light scattering. The shifts in the phase boundary are due to the effects of the additives on the chi parameter at the spinodal. All the additives appear to lower the chi parameter between the homopolymers; this is in conflict with the predicted Flory-Huggins behavior."

While past requirements for TBCs primarily addressed the function of insulation/ life extension of the metallic components, new demands necessitate a requirement for spallation resistance/strain tolerance, i.e., prime reliance, on the part of the TBC. In an extensive effort to incorporate these TBCs, a design-of-experiment approach was undertaken to develop tailored coating properties by processing under varied conditions. Efforts focusing on achieving durable/high-performance coatings led to dense vertically cracked (DVC) TBCs, exhibiting quasi-columnar microstructures approximating electron-beam physical-vapor-deposited (EB-PVD) coatings. Quantitative representation of the microstructural features in these vastly different coatings is obtained, in terms of porosity, opening dimensions, orientation, morphologies, and pore size distribution, by means of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) studies. Such comprehensive characterization, coupled with elastic modulus and thermal conductivity measurements of the coatings, help establish relationships between microstructure and properties in a systematic manner."

Small-angle neutron scattering experiments on micellar solutions indicate that the micelle aggregation number decreases significantly in the presence of drug solutes, causing the number density of micelles to increase. However, only slight changes were observed in the critical micelle concentration of F 127 in the presence of these drugs. Both anti-inflammatory agents were found to shift the liquid-to-gel and gel-to-liquid transitions of the copolymer to lower temperatures. This may be the result of an increase in the micellar volume fraction, caused by the presence of the hydrophobic drugs. Using an ultraviolet spectroscopy technique, we have also measured the solubilities and micelle-water partition coefficients (K-nw) of naproxen and indomethacin in water and F127 solutions. The values of K-mw for naproxen and indomethacin are 355 +/- 64 and 474 +/- 133, respectively. They are larger than previously reported lipid-water partition coefficients, indicating that F127 micelles may be a better choice for drug loading than lipid vesicles. The slightly greater effects of indomethacin on the gelation boundary as compared with naproxen may be attributable to a higher value of K-mw."

The corresponding carbopolyanions are prepared and oxidized to polyradicals in tetrahydrofuran-d(8). The measured values of S, from numerical fits of magnetization vs magnetic field data to Brillouin functions at low temperatures (T = 1.8-5 K), are S = 10 and S = 3.6-3.8 for polyradicais with 24 and 8 triarylmethyls, respectively. Magnetizations at saturation (M-sat) indicate that 60-80% of unpaired electrons are present at T = 1.8-5 K. Low-resolution shape reconstructions from the small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data indicate that both the polyradical with 24 triarylmethyls and its derivatives have dumbbell-like shapes with overall dimensions 2 x 3 x 4 nm, in agreement with the molecular shapes of the lowest energy conformations obtained from Monte Carlo conformational searches. On the basis of these shapes, the size of the magnetic anisotropy barrier in the polyradical, originating in magnetic shape anisotropy, is estimated to be in the milliKelvin range, consistent with the observed paramagnetic behavior at T greater than or equal to 1.8 K. For macromolecular polyradicals, with the elongated shape and the spin density similar to the polyradical with 24 triarylmethyls, it is predicted that the values of S on the order of 1000 or higher may be required for \"single-molecule-magnet\" behavior, i.e., superparamagnetic blocking (via coherent rotation of magnetization) at the readily accessible temperatures T > 2 K."

The rock microstructure is fractal (D = 2.47) in the pore-size range 10 Angstrom - 50 mum and Euclidean for larger length scales. The pore-size distribution is consistent with that determined by MP.

We determine the number densities, N, of droplets formed from small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments and the time intervals during which nucleation occurs, Deltat approximate to 10 mus, from static pressure measurements along the axis of the nozzle. Applying these techniques to nozzles with different expansion rates, we obtain the first isothermal nucleation rate measurements as a function of supersaturation for these devices with a relatively small error margin in J of +/-50%. At temperatures T of 210, 220, and 230 K, the maximum nucleation rates for D2O lie in the range 4 x 10(16) < J/cm(-3)s(-1) < 3 x 10(17) for supersaturations S ranging from 46 to 143. At the highest temperature, the predictions of classical nucleation theory lie slightly below the experimental points but are still within experimental error. At the lower temperatures, the classical predictions lie well below the measured values, The discrepancy increases as the temperature is lowered and exceeds the measurement error bars. In contrast, the predictions of the empirical temperature correction function to the classical theory proposed by Wolk and Strey (Wolk, J.; Strey, R. J. Phys. Chem. B 2001, 105, 11683) agree quite well with the experimental data points over the entire supersaturation and temperature ranges. Finally, we apply the first and second nucleation theorems to the data and directly estimate the number of molecules in the critical cluster n* and the excess internal energy E-x(n*), respectively. The agreement between these values and the classical values predicted assuming that the critical cluster is a compact spherical object is really quite good even though under our conditions n* is less than 10. The good agreement for the classical values of the excess internal energy implies that the poor temperature dependence of the classical rate predictions arises from the classical theory's failure to treat correctly the excess internal entropy of the critical cluster."

Microstructure information on porosity, void orientation distribution, void mean opening dimensions and internal surface areas have been obtained using SANS. XMT (X-ray synchrotron microtomography) has been used to nondestructively image the microstructural features in 3D at a 2.7-mum spatial resolution over a 2-3 turn field of view. 3D medial axis analysis has been used for the quantitative analysis of the coarse void space in order to obtain information on the porosity, specific surface area, pore connectivity and size distribution of the larger voids in the coatings. The results reveal different pore morphologies for the two spray processes. While only globular pores are imaged in the plasma sprayed coatings due to the spatial resolution limit, highly layered porosity is imaged in the HVOF coating. When the quantitative SANS and XMT information are combined, the different thermal and mechanical properties of the two different coating types can be explained in terms of their distinctly different void microstructures."

The microstructure and surface area were measured using both small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and nitrogen gas sorption. The intensity in the SANS data regime corresponding to the volume fractal C-S-H gel phase increased significantly on leaching, and the total surface area per unit specimen volume measured by SANS doubled on leaching from C/S=3.0 to near C/S=1.0. The nitrogen BET surface area of the WPC pastes, expressed in the same units, increased on decalcification as well, although not as sharply. The primary cause of these changes is a transformation of the high-density \"inner product\" C-S-H gel, which normally has a low specific surface area as measured by SANS and nitrogen gas sorption, into a morphology with a high specific surface area. The volume fractal exponent corresponding to the C-S-H gel phase decreased with decalcification from 2.3 to 2.0, indicating that the equiaxed 5 nm C-S-H globule building blocks that form the volume fractal microstructure of normal, unleached cement paste are transformed by decalcification into sheetlike structures of increasing thickness."

The fluids consist of a suspension of ~7 nm magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles coated with a bifunctional polymer layer comprised of an outer hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) region for colloidal stability and an inner hydrophobic poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) region for solubilization of organic compounds. The inner region of the polymer shell is increasingly depleted of water as the fraction of PPO side chains increases. The incorporation of PPO side chains also leads to a small increase in interparticle attraction. The lattice model predicted a shell structure similar to that of a PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer (Pluronic) micelle, with equivalent levels of hydration but with more PEO present in the PPO-rich regions, as the side chains grafted to the surface are less able to segregate than when in free micellar systems."
